# ICS-Classes-Discord-Bot
This is a Discord bot that implements the Discord API and the HTML parser BeautifulSoup (Python package) to parse through UCI's class listing page for ICS students (https://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/courses) and professor ratings from http://www.ratemyprofessors.com to find the best quarters to take ICS classes with which professors.
